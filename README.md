# brototype_competition_entry
How to Use the InstallerSince I cannot send a .zip file directly, I have written a script that builds the project for you.
Copy the Python code from the file above (install_project.py).
Paste it into a new file on your computer named install.py.
Run the script in your terminal:python install.py
A new folder named brototype_competition_entry will appear.O
pen the README.txt inside that folder to see the 2 commands needed to start the servers.
